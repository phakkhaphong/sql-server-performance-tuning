    LAB: Module 04 - Memory Grant Spills (Sort Warnings)
    
    DEMO CONTEXT:
        In Demos 01-03, you monitored memory usage (Buffers, Clerks).
        In this Lab, you will generate a "Memory Spill" (Sort Warning) by forcing 
        a large sort that exceeds the allocated Memory Grant.

    OBJECTIVE:
        Simulate a spill to TempDB and observe the performance impact (and the Warning in Execution Plan).
